		Automatically generate documentation out of React/React Native Component

</div>

This summer, I was pleased to get selected for Google Summer of Code'21 under the organization [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-elements). Working under the organization, my project was to **generate documentation automatically out of the UI components and present it in the Docusaurus website**.

The purpose of creating this repository is to maintain a report summary of my GSoC work and this may also serve as a guide for future GSoC aspirants and a reference to the developers and contributors to the project.

## üìô Abstract

[React Native Elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-elements) is a cross-platform UI toolkit built on/for React Native. With a weekly download by 90k+ users and backed by a huge community, it provides UI components that can be used in your native application for the platform of Android/iOS/Web.

The documentation of the project was maintained manually previously i.e., suppose I want to change/add/remove a prop or a new component to the project the markdown file had to be changed manually. The process is tiring and new contributors may often forget to do so. So, during the summers I took the change this process and make a workflow such that the generation is automatic. This should be **fast and maintainable**.

## üìù Deliverables

The deliverables of the project are as follows:

- [x] Efficient Development Setup
- [x] Re-structure and Refactor code to have a common pattern.
- [x] Maintain the Usage/Examples of the component as they are needed to be updated manually.
- [x] Refactor and rename the directory structure such that Autogen is successful.
  - Convert the code-base to have all the functional components.
- [x] Commenting on all the components and props.
  - Adding descriptions.
  - Adding prop descriptions.
  - Ensuring a common pattern is followed.
- [x] Writing **scripts to extract data out**(in JS/TS) of it in the form of JSON.
- [x] Converting the JSON data to Markdown.
- [ ] Automating the process such that the workflow works automatically whenever there is a change in the prop/definition or component code.

All of the listed deliverables were completed within the GSoC period. üéâ

## üì¶ Working product

The work can be found here - [Official Website of React native elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/next/). Please refer to the component docs.

**I have also written a blog on how it works attached [here](https://deploy-preview-3145--react-native-elements.netlify.app/blog/2021/08/12/auto-generation-of-docs).**
